Steps to build the kernel:

Download and install the cross toolchain gcc version 4 for Linux 2.6.

$ cd /opt
$ tar xjf mipseltools-gcc412-glibc261.tar.bz2
$ export PATH=/opt/mipseltools-gcc412-glibc261/bin:$PATH

Download the linux kernel tarball linux-2.6.24.3.tar.bz2 and unpack it:

$ tar xjf linux-2.6.24.3.tar.bz2

Download the latest kernel patch and patch it to the kernel tree:

$ cd linux-2.6.24.3
$ gzip -cd ../linux-2.6.24.3-jz-yyyymmdd.patch.gz | patch -p1

Make defconfig of the JZSOC based platform, eg:

$ make cetus_defconfig	(JZ4755 based CETUS board)
or
$ make apus_defconfig	(JZ4750 based APUS board)
or
$ make pavo_defconfig	(JZ4740 based PAVO board)
or
$ make pmp_defconfig	(JZ4730 based PMP board)

Build the kernel:

$ make xconfig
$ make uImage
or
# make zImage
or
# make modules

    value of mtdblock_jz_invalid in partition_info[] in drivers/mtd/nand/jz47xx_nand.c.
    And which mode a partition works with, cpu mode or dma mode, could be determined by the 
    value of cpu_mode in partition_info[] in drivers/mtd/nand/jz47xx_nand.c.
